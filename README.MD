# Souls Vision
Souls Vision adds a customizable overlay to the top-right corner of the screen (by default), showing additional information about the currently targeted enemy, including HP, Stamina, Stance, and Buildup bars for effects (like Poison and Frostbite).

## Features
* **Stat Bars**: Shows the current and maximum HP, FP, Stamina, and Stagger/Poise of the targeted enemy.
  * The FP bar usually only appear to "player-like" enemies
* **Best Effects**: Shows the best effects to use against the targeted enemy, based on the lowest value necessary to trigger them.
* **Immune Effects**: Shows the effects that the targeted enemy is immune to in gray at the right of the best effects.
* **Buildup Bars**: Shows the current buildup of effects like Poison, Scarlet Rot, Hemorrhage, Death Blight, Frostbite, Sleep, and Madness.
  * Only appear if the enemy has some effect being applied to it.
* **Customizable**: Highly customizable, with options to change the positions, sizes, and visibility of the bars.
  * The config file is generated the first time the game is opened with the mod, and it is reloaded automatically every time it is edited.
  * The `opacity` param requires the game to be restarted to take effect.
* **Draggable Overlay**: The overlay can be dragged around the screen by clicking and dragging it.
  * The parameter `dragOverlay` must be set to `true` in the config file to enable this feature.
  * I recommend enabling entering a menu (like Equipment) to show mouse cursor to make it easier to drag the overlay. (I'm working on a better way to do this)

## Configuration
<details>
<summary>Config file details</summary>
The first time the game opens with the mod it will generate a default sv_config.json placing the bars at the top-right of the screen. Every time the config file is edited, it will be reloaded automatically.

## Compatibility
Souls Vision was developed and tested on version 1.16, it is expected to work with previous and future versions as long as the game’s internal structures remain unchanged since it relies on memory reading. No incompatibilities with other mods are anticipated, but conflicts could arise if another mod hooks the same memory locations. Either way, let me know if any kind of error occurs.

## Installation
Add the `SoulsVision.dll` and `sv_assets` to the `mods` folder from [Elden Mod Loader](https://www.nexusmods.com/eldenring/mods/117)
